## 2026-02-03 - Glassmorphic Header Interactivity
**Learning:** In a mobile-first UI using glassmorphism (white/20 background with backdrop-blur), icon-only buttons can feel visually integrated but tactilely "disconnected" if they lack immediate physical feedback.
**Action:** Always pair glassmorphic interactive elements with `active:scale-95` and `transition-all` to maintain a responsive feel, especially when using low-contrast icon-only buttons in headers.
